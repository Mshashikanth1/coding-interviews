    * We are developing a rewards bidding system - BidBlitz for Flipkart, where Flipkart plus members will have the opportunity to win a lavish item each day.
As an engineer, your task is to build a feature that allows members to place bids using their Flipkart Super Coins.
● The winner of the item will be the member who places the lowest bid.

Guidelines

● Input can be read from a file or STDIN or coded in a driver method. [No Api and No UI]
● Output can be written to a file or STDOUT. [No Api]
● Store all interim/output data in-memory data structures. The usage of databases is not allowed.
● Restrict internet usage to looking up syntax.
● Language should be Java only.
● Save your code/project by your name and email it or upload on the google drive link provided. Your program will be executed on another machine. So, explicitly specify dependencies, if any, in your email.

Expectations

● The code should be demo-able (very important). The code should be functionally correct and complete.
● At the end of this interview round, an interviewer will provide multiple inputs to your program for which it is expected to work
● The code should handle edge cases properly and fail gracefully. Add suitable exception handling, wherever applicable.
● An example would be to display an error message when the member trying to register for same event again or member does not have enough super coins to bid
● The code should be readable, modular, testable, and extensible. Use intuitive names for your variables, methods, and classes.
● It should be easy to add/remove functionality without rewriting a lot of code.
● Do not write a monolithic code.
● Don’t use any databases.
